# Video Games
I enjoy many video games and here I will talk about a few that I'm currently playing
1. Smite - I've played this game for more than 6 years and I just never get tired of it. Oldie but goodie.
2. Forts - A game me and my friends enjoy queing up and playing casually but still getting some competition in.
3. Hunt: Showdown - A game me and by buddies enjoy playing when we want to play competitively.
4. Stardew Valley - When me and the other Joes want to chill and talk while doing some gaming.
